Configure and Monitor for SOCKS V5 Server

1. Initial negotiation

   Once the SOCKS V5 server has started, and the client has connected to the
   monitor port (default xxxx).
   
   Username/Password request:

           +----+------+----------+------+----------+
           |VER | ULEN |  UNAME   | PLEN |  PASSWD  |
           +----+------+----------+------+----------+
           | 1  |  1   | 1 to 255 |  1   | 1 to 255 |
           +----+------+----------+------+----------+

   The VER field contains the current version of the subnegotiation,
   which is X'01'. The ULEN field contains the length of the UNAME field
   that follows. The UNAME field contains the username as known to the
   source operating system. The PLEN field contains the length of the
   PASSWD field that follows. The PASSWD field contains the password
   association with the given UNAME.

   The server verifies the supplied UNAME and PASSWD, and sends the
   following response:

                        +----+--------+
                        |VER | STATUS |
                        +----+--------+
                        | 1  |   1    |
                        +----+--------+

   A STATUS field of X'00' indicates success. If the server returns a
   `failure' (STATUS value other than X'00') status, it MUST close the
   connection.

2. Monitor and Configure

    Once logged in the server sends the following metrics:
        
        o   ECON - number of establised connections
        o   ACON - number of actual connections
        o   BYTES - total bytes transferred

           +----------+----------+----------+
           |   ECON   |   ACON   |  BYTES   | 
           +----------+----------+----------+
           |  32 bits |  32 bits |  64 bits |  
           +----------+----------+----------+


        Commands
                          Request format
                +----------+----------+----------+
                |   CODE   |   ARG    |   MODE   | 
                +----------+----------+----------+
                |  8 bits  |  32 bits |   1 bit  |  
                +----------+----------+----------+

        This server received this request.
        CODE represents the command code, ARG the argument if it is needed
        and MODE can be 1 for write and 0 for read. 

        o METRICS - CODE 0x01 - send actual value of ECON, ACON and bytes. Refreshed what is sent 
        and the beggining of the connection

        o CREDENTIALS - CODE 0x02 - send sniffed credentials on an string, with the following format:

        [SYS_USER],[PROTOCOL],[SNI_USER],[SNI_PASS]\0

        o I/O BUFFER - CODE 0x03

        o Doh Server IP - CODE 0x04
